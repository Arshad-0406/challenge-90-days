HTML Paragraph Element (<p>)
1. What it is

The <p> tag is used to define a paragraph of text in HTML.

It is a block-level element, meaning it starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.

2. Basic Syntax

<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
<p>Another paragraph here.</p>

Each <p> creates a separate block of text.

Browsers automatically add space (margin) above and below paragraphs.

3. Characteristics

Paragraphs are used for regular text content.

Can contain inline elements like <strong>, <em>, <a>, <span>, <br>, etc.

4. Example with Inline Elements

<p>This is a <strong>bold</strong> word and this is <em>italic</em> text.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://example.com">Example.com</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Line break here:<br>Next line of the paragraph.</p>

5. Best Practices

Use <p> for blocks of text, not just single words.

Don’t use <br> repeatedly to create spacing; use CSS margin/padding instead.

Keep paragraphs short and readable for better user experience.

6. Styling Paragraphs

You can style <p> using CSS:
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">
  This paragraph is blue with larger text and better line spacing.
</p>


7. Key Points

Paragraphs are block-level → start on a new line.

Can contain inline elements for formatting.

Browsers add default spacing before and after paragraphs.

Can be styled with CSS for colors, fonts, and spacing.
