HTML Self-Closing Tags
1. What They Are

Self-closing tags are HTML tags that do not have a closing tag (</tag>).

They are used for elements that don’t need any content inside.

Syntax:
<tagname />

Note: In HTML5, you can also just write <tagname> without the /.

2. Common Self-Closing Tags
| Tag       | Purpose                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `<br>`    | Inserts a line break (new line)                   |
| `<hr>`    | Inserts a horizontal rule (line)                  |
| `<img>`   | Embeds an image                                   |
| `<input>` | Creates a form input field                        |
| `<link>`  | Links external resources like CSS                 |
| `<meta>`  | Defines metadata like charset or viewport         |
| `<embed>` | Embeds external content like PDF, audio, or video |

3. Examples

<p>This is a paragraph.<br>Next line here.</p>

<hr>

<img src="image.jpg" alt="Sample Image">

<input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<meta charset="UTF-8">

<embed src="file.pdf" width="300" height="200">

4. Notes

No content inside: Self-closing tags cannot wrap other content.

Inline vs Block: Some self-closing tags are inline (<br>, <img>), some act like block elements (<hr>).

HTML5 flexibility: You can write <br> instead of <br />—both work.

In short:

Self-closing tags are standalone elements that don’t need a closing tag.

They are commonly used for images, line breaks, horizontal lines, inputs, and metadata.
