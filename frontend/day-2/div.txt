<div> stands for division.

It is a block-level container used to group and organize HTML elements.

By default, it does not add any styling or visual change—it’s mainly for structuring content.

Key Characteristics

1)Block-level element

Always starts on a new line.

Takes the full width of its parent by default.

2)Container for styling

Commonly used with CSS to apply styles, layouts, and formatting to grouped elements.

3)No semantic meaning

Unlike <header>, <section>, <article>, etc., <div> does not describe the meaning of content.

It is purely structural.

<div>
   <!-- Content goes here -->
</div>
