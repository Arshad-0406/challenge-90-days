1) In <input>, why do we take name and value?

name → The key used when sending form data to the server.

value → The data that is sent to the server.

Example:

<input type="text" name="username" value="John">


What user sees: a text box with "John" inside.

What server receives after form submission:

username=John


Is it compulsory that value and content appearing on webpage are same?

No.

For text inputs, the value attribute sets the default text.

If the user types something else, that new text becomes the value sent to the server.

So, the displayed text (user input) and the value attribute can be different after user types.

2) In <option>, why do we give value?
<select name="country">
  <option value="in">India</option>
  <option value="us">USA</option>
</select>


What user sees: "India" and "USA".

What server receives: country=in or country=us.

Reason: Sometimes you want to send short codes (in, us) instead of full text.
If no value is given → the text inside <option> is sent.

 3) Is it compulsory to define name and value in <input>?

name → Compulsory if you want to send data to server.
Without name, that input field’s data will not be sent in form submission.

value →  Not always compulsory.

For text/number inputs → value is optional (user types it).

For radio/checkbox → value is very important, otherwise server won’t know which option was chosen.

Example:

<input type="checkbox" name="subscribe" value="yes"> Subscribe


If checked → server receives subscribe=yes.
If no value given → browser sends subscribe=on (default).
