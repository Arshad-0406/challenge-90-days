Notes on <figure> Tag in HTML
ðŸ”¹ What is <figure>?

The <figure> tag is a semantic HTML5 element.

It is used to group media content (like images, diagrams, code snippets, charts, illustrations, etc.) along with a caption.

Usually paired with the <figcaption> tag to describe the content.

<figure>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful sunset">
  <figcaption>A beautiful sunset over the mountains.</figcaption>
</figure>

Helps with accessibility â†’ screen readers can interpret the caption.

Keeps content self-contained â†’ can be moved anywhere in the document without losing meaning.

Difference Between <figure> and <img>

| Tag        | Purpose                                                                           |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<img>`    | Embeds an image only.                                                             |
| `<figure>` | Groups an image (or other media) **with an optional caption** for better meaning. |


Important Points

<figcaption> is optional but strongly recommended.

<figcaption> can be placed before or after the content inside <figure>.

A <figure> can contain any media type, not just images.
