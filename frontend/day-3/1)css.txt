Notes: Why Do We Need CSS?
1. Separation of Concerns

HTML → handles the structure and content of a webpage (headings, paragraphs, images, forms, etc.).

CSS → handles the presentation (colors, fonts, layout, spacing, animations, etc.).
This separation makes code easier to read, maintain, and update.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Consistency Across Pages

With CSS, you can define a single stylesheet and apply it to multiple web pages.

This ensures a consistent look and feel across the entire website.
Example: Same font style, color scheme, and navigation bar for all pages.
--------------------------------------------------------------
3. Better Design and Aesthetics

HTML alone makes web pages look plain and basic.

CSS allows customization:

Fonts, colors, spacing, alignment

Backgrounds, gradients, borders

Hover effects and transitions
Makes websites more attractive and user-friendly.

------------------------------------------------------
4. Responsive Web Design

CSS enables layouts that adjust to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Techniques:

Media Queries (e.g., different styles for small vs. large screens)

Flexbox and Grid for flexible layouts
Essential for mobile-friendly websites.
-------------------------------------------------------------
5. Reusability & Maintainability

Define styles once in a CSS file → reuse across multiple elements/pages.

If you want to change the theme (e.g., color scheme), just update the CSS file instead of editing every HTML tag.
Saves time and effort.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Performance & Faster Development

CSS reduces the need for inline styling in HTML, leading to cleaner and lighter code.

External CSS files can be cached by browsers → faster loading times.
