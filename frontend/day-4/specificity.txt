CSS Cascade, Specificity & Inheritance
1. Cascade

The cascade is how the browser decides which CSS rules to apply when there are multiple rules targeting the same element.
The decision is made based on three main factors:

Importance

Rules marked with !important override normal rules.

Example:

p { color: blue !important; }
p { color: red; }  /* Will be ignored */


Specificity

More specific selectors override less specific ones.

(Explained in detail below ⬇)

Source Order

If specificity and importance are the same, the last declared rule wins.

Example:

h1 { color: green; }
h1 { color: orange; }  /* This wins */

2. Specificity

Specificity is a ranking system that decides which CSS rule applies when multiple selectors target the same element.

Inline styles → Highest priority.

ID selectors (#id) → Strong.

Class selectors (.class), attribute selectors, pseudo-classes (:hover) → Medium.

Type selectors (h1, p, div) and pseudo-elements (::before) → Low.

Universal selector (*), combinators (+, >, ~), and inheritance → Lowest.

Specificity Weight System (think of it as points):

Inline style → 1000

ID → 100

Class, attribute, pseudo-class → 10

Element, pseudo-element → 1

 Example:

#main p { color: red; }   /* Specificity = 100 + 1 = 101 */
.content p { color: blue; }  /* Specificity = 10 + 1 = 11 */
p { color: green; }  /* Specificity = 1 */


 Final color → red (highest specificity).

3. Inheritance

Some CSS properties are inherited by default from the parent element.

Example (inherited by default): color, font-family, line-height.

Example (not inherited): margin, padding, border, background.

Controlling Inheritance

inherit → Forces property to take parent’s value.

initial → Resets property to browser’s default.

unset → Acts as inherit for inheritable properties, otherwise initial.

Example:

p {
  color: inherit;   /* Takes color from parent */
  margin: initial;  /* Resets margin to default */
}

Key Takeaways

Cascade = importance (!important) → specificity → source order.

Specificity = ranking system (inline > ID > class > element).

Inheritance = some properties are passed down, others aren’t.

Final Cascade Order (from strongest to weakest)

Importance (!important)

Specificity (inline > ID > class > element)

Position (last rule wins)

Type/Origin (author > user > browser)

Inheritance (only for inheritable properties)
